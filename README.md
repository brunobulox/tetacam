Asterisk/Motion to alert on webcam

The idea here was to create a motion sensing system with webcam capabilities as well. This could be used to monitor and alert on just about anything. The base of the system is Asterisk for a PBX and Motion as a motion detector. Database driven selections allow you to choose what phones/emails are contacted in the event of an alert. Also included is the ability to upload the motion clip to google drive.  - Mark Haislip
